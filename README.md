This is a project for [Michale Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynch_(geneticist))'s **Evolutions of proteins and cells** class.

I wanted to learn more about some signaling mechanisms and asked if anyone was interested in collaborating in a project.  
Melene came up with c-di-gmp which is a pretty interesting bacterial signaling molecule.
We eventually decided to look into c-di-gmp binding domains in the domain co-occurrance networks for a whole bunch of bacteria.
This analysis ensued.
